    <p class="what-makes-text">Out with the old lecture and paper-writing methods. In with interactive media design! Your teachers play an important role in the shift from talking at kids to engaging with kids.</p>
    <p class="what-makes-text">Most likely, “professional” and “development” aren’t your teachers’ favorite words. They probably spend those days lined up in chairs, listening to someone talk—or possibly catching up on sleep. Let’s face it, teachers don’t need more lectures. They need active, ongoing support, and the tools to experiment with new approaches in the classroom.</p>
    <p class="what-makes-text">Nowadays, teachers are really feeling the heat. They face constant pressure to support students in not only the academic content, but digital media, coding and design. This requires more expertise than ever before. Project-based professional development is the sigh of relief that teachers need. It all happens in the classroom, which means teachers are getting the practical support they need, and students are getting a richer, more innovative experience.</p>
    <p class="what-makes-text">The Field Day fellowship is PD that builds connections with the community—kids will be sharing their projects with their friends and families and maybe even making games about their neighborhoods!</p>

Today’s project opened up the students to do this. I saw their self-esteem increase when they did something difficult.”

  <h2>WHAT'S THE INVESTMENT?</h2>
  <p>How much does it cost to not invest in your teachers?</p>
  <p>
    Innovation does cost you something, but ignoring it will cost way more. Teachers end up stagnant or super overwhelmed. Classrooms get stuck in the same old methods, instead of experimenting with all the technology students are so into. The world moves fast, and it’s not gonna wait for your teachers to catch up. Other methods of professional development eat up your money and teachers’ time, without making a real impact. Not sure if the price is worth it? Lack of innovation is already costing your school more than you think.

      <h2>KICK OFF</h2>
      <p>
        August 23 2016, 9am-4pm. An action-packed day of project design with the Field Day team. We discover game design and learning theory in context of creating the lesson plan and the student project.

      <h2>MEET UPS</h2>
      <p>
        Your teachers need support? Good news&mdash;support is our middle name! We’ll host online meetups and site visits throughout the semester as the fellows finish their planning and implement their project. Plan for 3-5 one-hour meet ups.
      </p>

      <h2>PROJECT</h2>
      <p>
        Students will spend four to six weeks researching and building their own interactive games about a social science topic. Not only will they need to explore their topic deeply, but they will be practicing communication, writing, design and computer skills.
      </p>

      <p><img src="assets/arrow-right.png"></p>
      <h2>WRAP UP PARTY!</h2>
      <p>
        Date TBA. We’ll take care of research and evaluative study, share the materials you’ve created with other teachers, and wrap it all up with a big celebration at UW-Madison!

  <h2>WILL TEACHERS HAVE TIME?</h2>
  <p>
    We know they’re already super duper busy.  We work around their schedules. We want to protect teachers’ time and make sure this works for them.
  </p>
  <p>
    How many more boooorrrrrriiiiiiiinngggggg professional seminars can teachers attend? Teachers need to maintain licensure and earn course credit, but why not have fun and be challenged while doing it? We work to make sure that all the work teachers invest goes directly towards their career development and portfolios.
