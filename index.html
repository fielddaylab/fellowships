      Out with the old lecture and paper-writing methods, In with interactive media design! Your teachers play an important role in the shift from talking at kids to engaging with kids.
    </p>

    <p class="what-makes-text">
      Most likely, “professional” and “development” aren’t your teachers’ favorite words. They probably spend those days lined up in chairs, listening to someone talk--or possibly catching up on sleep. Let’s face it, teachers don’t need more lectures. They need active, ongoing support, and the tools to experiment with new approaches in the classroom.
    </p>

    <p class="what-makes-text">
      This fall, our fellows will design a final project that kids--and teachers!--can have fun with. Instead of writing a paper, students will create interactive games based on social sciences content. We’ll work directly with your teachers as they guide their students in developing designs, doing research, and making their own mobile games.
    </p>

    <p class="what-makes-text">
      Nowadays, teachers are really feeling the heat. They face constant pressure to support students in not only the academic content, but digital media, coding and design. This requires more expertise than ever before. Project-based professional development is the sigh of relief that teachers need. It all happens in the classroom, which means teachers are getting the practical support they need, and students are getting a richer, more innovative experience.
    </p>

    <p class="what-makes-text">
      The Field Day fellowship is PD that builds connections with the community - kids will be sharing their projects with their friends and families and maybe even making games about their neighborhoods!
    </p>

      “These kids are the future. We want them to be creative, to problem solve, to work together. It’s not always easy to teach creativity, but it’s important because it leads to higher levels of thinking and processing, learning through trial and error, learning how to fix problems. Today’s project opened up the students to do this. I saw their self-esteem increase when they did something difficult.”

  <h2>WHAT'S THE INVESTMENT?</h2>
  <p>How much does it cost to not invest in your teachers?</p>
  <p>
    Innovation does cost you something, but ignoring it will cost way more. Teachers end up stagnant or super overwhelmed. Classrooms get stuck in the same old methods, instead of experimenting with all the technology students’ are so into. The world moves fast, and it’s not gonna wait for your teachers to catch up. Other methods of professional development eat up your money and teachers’ time, without making a real impact. Not sure if the price is worth it? Lack of innovation is already costing your school more than you think.

      <h2>SIGN UP!<br>$2000 PER TEACHER</h2>
      <p>
        We strongly suggest sending 2 teachers per school. Come on! Doing things together is just more fun (and it helps to have a friend to lean on when you run into challenges.)

        Students will spend four to six weeks researching and building their own interactive games about a social science topic. Not only will they need to explore their topic deeply, but they will be practicing communication, writing, design and computer skills.

  <p>
    We know they’re already super duper busy.  We work around their schedules. We want to protect teachers’ time and make sure this works for them.
  </p>
  <p>
    How many more boooorrrrrriiiiiiiinngggggg professional seminars can teachers attend? Teachers need to maintain licensure and earn course credit, but why not have fun and be challenged while doing it? We work directly with the CESAs to make sure that all the work teachers invest goes directly towards their career development and portfolios.
